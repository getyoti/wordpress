== Installation ==

We have a few simple steps we need you to fill before you get started:

= Requirements =

* This plugin works with the WordPress Business Plan package.
* You must also have downloaded the Yoti app with an ID document attached.

= Step1: Installing the plugin =

Import the plugin into your WordPress dashboard:

1. Log on to your Wordpress Admin Dashboard: e.g. https://www.wordpress-url.org.uk/wp-admin
2. Navigate on the left hand side to Plugins > Add New
3. Search for Yoti and install it
4. Activate the plugin on the same screen

= Step 2: Setting up your Yoti Application =

If you are a business, please create a Yoti organisation by visiting [here.](https://www.yoti.com/dashboard/login-organisations)

For information on how to create an organisation please visit our [developer site.](https://www.yoti.com/developers/documentation/#introduction)

Once this is completed, or for personal use please access the [dashboard](https://www.yoti.com/dashboard/login) to create a new application. Note: if you have completed your organisation steps above you will need to ensure you are within your organisation dashboard by:

* Clicking your profile photo on the top right
* Select organisation

This will then lead you to create a new application.

Specify the basic details of your application such as the name, description and optional logo. These details can be whatever you desire and will not affect the plugin's functionality.

The Data tab - Specify any attributes you'd like users to share. You must select at least one. If you plan to allow new user registrations, we recommended choosing Given Name(s), Family Name and Email Address at a minimum.

The Integration tab - Here is where you specify the callback URL. The URL can be found by going to your Yoti settings page which is located in your WordPress admin dashboard.

NOTE: If you get redirected to your WordPress frontpage instead of the Admin area, simply add /wp-admin to the URL.

The Key tab - Here is where your keys are generated which will be inputted into the plugin settings. You will need to download your pem file and store it somewhere safe as it will be used as part of the plugin set up.

= Step 3: Plugin Setup =

To set things up, navigate on WordPress to Settings > Yoti. You will be asked to add the following information:

* Yoti App ID is the unique identifier of your specific application.
* Yoti Scenario ID is used to render the inline QR code.
* Yoti SDK ID is the SDK identifier generated by Yoti Dashboard in the Key tab when you create your app. Note this is not your Application Identifier, which is needed by your client-side code.
* Company Name will replace WordPress wording in the warning message displayed on the custom login form.
* Yoti PEM File is the application pem file. It can be downloaded only once from the Keys tab in your Yoti Dashboard. Please do not include the Zip File, just the pem file is adequate.
* Change your call back URL on Yoti Dashboard: Log in to your dashboard and change your call back URL to the one provided on your Yoti Settings page. This is located within your application, on the Integration tab

= Step 4: Adding the widget =

Now your Yoti plugin is all set up you will need to add the button to your WordPress page.

To do this navigate to Appearance -> Widgets.

Please place the Yoti Widget where you deem appropriate.

= Step 5: Testing =

Log out of your WordPress account and go back to your site.

Test the Yoti button.

= Extras: =

The Yoti plugin has been developed to allow existing users to link their account with the below use cases:

1) Only allow existing WordPress users to link their Yoti account - This setting will prevent a new user to register and/or login using Yoti if they don't already have an account on your WordPress website. If enabled, when a new user tries to scan the Yoti QR code, they will be redirected to the login/register page with an error message displayed.

2) Attempt to link Yoti email address with Wordpress account for first time users - This setting enables linking a Yoti account to a WordPress user if the email from both platforms is identical.

3) Prevent users who have not passed age verification to access your site - This setting will not allow someone who does not pass the age verification condition set in the Yoti Dashboard (e.g. over 18) to register or link their account with Yoti.

This is found in Yoti plugin settings.
