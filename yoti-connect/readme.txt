== Installation ==

We have a few simple steps we need you to fill before you get started:

1) Download the Yoti app and add at least one ID document (either your passport or driving licence) so that we can confirm your name, date of birth and photo.

2) Create an application and decide what attributes you would like the end user to share - see screenshot.

3) Upload the plugin and input the details below which are available on your dashboard:

	-Yoti App ID - which is the unique identifier for your specific application.
	-Yoti Scenario ID: Used to render the inline QR code.
	-Yoti SDK ID - which is the SDK identifier generated by Yoti Dashboard in the Key tab when you create your app. Note this is not your Application Identifier which is needed by your client-side code.
	-Yoti PEM File - which is the application pem file. It can be downloaded only once 	from the Keys tab in your Yoti Dashboard.

4) Once this is completed you can move your Yoti widget to where appropriate on your site.
Yoti generates the user their own ID e.g. yoti connect-4 so if you would like to update your username, please change your nickname on your user profile.

To import the Yoti SDK inside your project:

Log on to the admin console of your WordPress website. e.g. https://www.wordpressurl.org.uk/wp-admin

2) Navigate to at `Plugins > Add New`.

3) Search for Yoti and install and activate the plug in.

To set things up, navigate on WordPress to `Settings > Yoti Connect`.

 Here you will be asked to add the following information from your dashboard:

	-Yoti App ID

	-Yoti Scenario ID

	-Yoti SDK ID

	-Yoti PEM File

You can find our Yoti button in the widget section and can place it where you see appropriate.
